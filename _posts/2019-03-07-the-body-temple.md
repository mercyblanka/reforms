_**"My body, my choice"**_ is probably something you've ever heard before. As much as we may like to think that we have the freedom to do as we please with our bodies because they are ours, that's really not true.

Paul makes it clear:

> What? know ye not that **your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost** which is in you, which ye have of God, and **ye are not your own**? For ye are bought with a price: **therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God’s**. KJV — 1Corinthians 6:19,20

Three key points we can take from this scripture:

2. ye are not your own
3. glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God’s

Everything that defiles the body should by God's grace be shunned. If we ourselves would not be comfortable living in unclean houses, we cannot surely expect God to dwell in us while we defile our bodies. It is important here to note a couple of things that may lead to defilement:
