> And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart. KJV — Jeremiah 29:13

In the simplicity of this verse is found the reason why so many of us are never fully at peace as Christians. We desire to seek God, but we do not follow through wholeheartedly. There is always something holding us back and the Christian experience seems always a battle, and this is a battle we need to fight continually if we would be true Christians.

> The warfare against self is the greatest battle that was ever fought. The yielding of self, surrendering all to the will of God, requires a struggle; but the soul must submit to God before it can be renewed in holiness. <sup>\*</sup>

It requires a more valiant struggle to overcome one's pride than an army. God desires to create in us the perfect character of Christ. He has all the ability and power, but he cannot do it unless we fully submit and commit. The whole heart must be yielded to God or the change can never be wrought in us by which we are to be restored to His likeness. We cannot be half the Lord's and half the world's. We are not God's children unless we are such entirely.

In giving ourselves to God, we must necessarily give up all that would separate us from him.

> But now, O LORD, thou art our father; we are the clay, and thou our potter; and we all are the work of thy hand. KJV — Isaiah 64:8

Every human being has an inborn determination to run his own life. I mean, we would feel more in control when doing things on our own. We don't trust that someone else will do it to our standards of perfection.

Surrender is not the surrender of the external life but of **the will**. When that is done, all is done. The one thing that God will never do is to force man's will into surrender. We have been given free will, and God in blessing us and revealing His love to us, expects us to freely yield up our will to Him.

> But many who profess to be His followers have an anxious, troubled heart, because they are afraid to trust themselves with God. They do not make a complete surrender to Him; for they shrink from the consequences that such a surrender may involve. Unless they do make this surrender, they cannot find peace. <sup>\*\*</sup>

Let this be our prayer:

> Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts: And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting. KJV — Psalm 139:23,24

As the prayer says: _**try me**_, the Lord may put us through experiences that will reveal the weaknesses in our hearts. If we trust Him to guide us, we will be refined more unto perfection.

We need those who will follow Christ fully, whose every faculty and power are consecrated to Jesus. It is not brainpower but heart power we need. What use would it be serving the Lord or being a Christian but not experiencing peace and happiness just because we refuse to surrender fully?

The Lord has promised to renew our hearts. Let us claim the precious promise.

> And I will give them an heart to know me, that I am the LORD: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God: for they shall return unto me with their whole heart. KJV — Jeremiah 24:7

> A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh. KJV — Ezekiel 36:26

God desires to restore you to Himself, to see His own purity and holiness reflected in you. And if you will but yield yourself to Him, He that _"hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ" Philippians 1:6_.

> Pray more fervently; believe more fully. As we come to distrust our own power, let us trust the power of our Redeemer, and we shall praise Him who is the health of our countenance. <sup>\*\*\*</sup>

We have been called to surrender our burdens to Christ and take His yoke of meekness and lowliness.

> Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. KJV — Matthew 11:28,29
