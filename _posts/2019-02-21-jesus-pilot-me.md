> God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. KJV — Psalm 46:1

_Jesus, Savior, Pilot Me_ is a wonderful hymn to inspire faith in Jesus Christ as He leads us through this storm tossed sea of life.

### Verse 1

> Jesus, Savior, pilot me, <br>
> Over life's tempestuous sea;<br>
> Unknown waves before me roll,<br>
> Hiding rock and treach'rous shoal;<br>
> Chart and compass come from Thee:<br>
> Jesus, Savior, pilot me!<br>

This world is not our home. As we journey through it to the promised land, like the disciples, many of us lose faith whenever things begin to go wrong in our lifes. Storms shake our ship and we are quick to ask, _"Master, carest thou not that we perish?" KJV — Mark 4:38_. The parable of Jesus calming the sea was written for our learnig (_Rom 15:4, 1 Cor 10:11_) and though it, we can take heart in knowing that all it takes is for Jesus to say the word, and there will be great calm (_Mark 4:39_).

### Verse 2

> As a mother stills her child,<br>
> Thou canst hush the ocean wild;<br>
> Boist'rous waves obey Thy will<br>
> When Thou say'st to them, "Be still!"<br>
> Wondrous Sov'reign of the sea,<br>
> Jesus, Saviour, pilot me!<br>

Jesus rules the raging sea (_Ps 89:9_). He stills the storm to a whisper and hushes the waves of the sea (_Ps 107:29_). He rebukes the sea, and makes it dry, and dries up all the rivers (_Nahum 1:4_). All power is His.

### Verse 3

> When at last I near the shore,<br>
> And the fearful breakers roar<br>
> 'Twixt me and the peaceful rest,<br>
> Then, while leaning on Thy breast,<br>
> May I hear Thee say to me,<br>
> "Fear not, I will pilot thee!"<br>

We are always in danger of forgetting how the Lord has led us in past years and losing faith when we face difficulties. It is written that the Israelites _"remembered not the multitude of God's mercies; but provoked him at the sea, even at the Red sea"_. It should always be our prayer that God reminds us frequently that he is at the helm of the ship, to lead us safely home. This is why memory verses are so important. Like Jesus during the temptation in the wilderness (_Luke 4:1-13_), reciting scripture memory texts will help us overcome the wiles of the devil.

Here are five simple memory texts you can memorise today to always remind you that God is in control:

> God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. KJV — Psalm 46:1

> Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness. KJV — Isaiah 41:10

> What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee. KJV — Psalm 56:3

> The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the LORD is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid? KJV — Psalm 27:1

And my personal favourite:

> In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world. KJV — John 16:33
