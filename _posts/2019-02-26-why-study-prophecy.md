> Believe in the LORD your God, so shall ye be established; believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper. KJV — 2Chronicles 20:20

It is not uncommon to hear the argument that the study of Bible prophecy may not be important for us today. Some books, like _The Revelation_, have even be termed "sealed" books giving the implication that they cannot be understood. At least not now. "God will explain everything when we get to heaven.", some may say.

While there are things that God in His wisdom has seen fit not to reveal to us, it is unsafe to neglect study and use that as an excuse (Deut 29:29). Jesus has given us His word and has preserved it for millennia (Ps 12:6,7) that we, today, may study to show ourselves approved unto God (2 Tim 2:15). And yes, the study of prophecy is expected of us. Especially is the study of the books of _Daniel_ and _The Revelation_ important for us who are living so close to the close of this earth's history.

Below are 5 reasons why studying Bible prophecy is important.

### 1. It proves the power of God

> Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there is none else; I am God, and there is none like me, Declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times the things that are not yet done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure: KJV — Isaiah 46:9,10

_See also: Isaiah 44:6-8 and 48:3-7_

Through the prophet Isaiah, God says time and again that He is the only one that can predict events before they happen and they actually do happen. He does this to prove His power, _"lest thou shouldest say, Mine idol hath done them" Is 48:5_. An honest consideration of the many prophecies that God spoke sometimes thousands of years before they were fulfilled exactly as He said they would (_sometimes accurate to the very day: see Exo 12:41,51_) should convince any doubter of the inspiration of The Bible as the word of God.

### 2. It increases our faith in Jesus

> Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am he. KJV — John 13:19

As God proves His power by predicting events and they do happen, we are led to have more faith in Him believing that if His word was true the first time, it will surely be true again and again for _"God is not a man, that he should lie" Num 23:19_.

### 3. It helps us to follow God's word

> The secret things belong unto the LORD our God: but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, **that we may do all the words of this law**. KJV — Deuteronomy 29:29

As our faith in Him grows, we are led to obey God's every word. Noah believed the prophecy that a flood was coming and by faith obeyed God's command to build an ark (_Heb 11:7_). Abraham believed the prophecy that God would make of him a great nation and by faith obeyed God's command to leave his country, _"and he went out, not knowing whither he went." Heb 11:8_. We can see then that contrary to popular belief, faith does not free us from obedience to God's commands. Satan gives people excuses to not study prophecy because he knows that as people's eyes are opened by prophetic light, they will be led to have faith which leads to obedience.

### 4. It acts as a light in the darkness

> We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts: KJV — 2Peter 1:19

Traveling the narrow way is hard enough as it is. Traveling it without a light to ensure you don't miss your step would surely be impossible. But God has not left us without light. In **all** of God's word I find _"a lamp unto my feet, And a light unto my path." Ps 119:105_.

Concerning the perils of these last days, Paul says that if we understand prophecy, then _that day, Jesus' soon return_ should not find us unawares and unprepared since we are not in the darkness. As we study prophecy, we become _"children of light, and the children of the day" 1 Thes 5:4,5_, so that when Jesus comes, we will be ready to receive Him.

### 5. It is a great consolation

> For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. KJV — Romans 8:18

If you've ever lost a loved one, it is always a great consolation to think that one day, you will see them again on that sea of glass in heaven. It encourages us to look forward to Jesus' prophecy of coming again, that "_blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ" Tit 2:13_

I can go to great lengths on this point as I feel very strongly about it, but I here quote five verses from the 21st chapter of _Revelation_ and encourage you, dear reader, to go ahead and read the 22nd chapter. I pray that it may encourage you to seek deeper into what God has to say in that wonderful book and the glories that have been prepared for those that overcome.

> And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.
> And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.
> And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God.
> And **God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away**.
> And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, **I make all things new**. And he said unto me, Write: for **these words are true and faithful**. KJV — Revelation 21:1-5
